# View Node Package - Visual Studio Code Extension

How often were you in the position that you are writing some Node.JS code and you can't remember
something about a package that you are using. You end up switching to your browser, look up the
the NPM package and then navigate to the repository.

**This extension allows you to instantly switch from VS Code to the repository or documentation of
the respective package. **

# How to use 

1. Navigate to the line where you `require(...)` the package.

2. Run the `View Node Package Source` command.

3. If you selected multiple `require` statements or a line without one, the extension will scan the document and offer you options.
